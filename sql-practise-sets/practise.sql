SELECT * FROM emp WHERE salary > 500

--How do you sort employees by HIRE_DATE in descending order?
SELECT * FROM emp ORDER BY HIRE_DATE DESC

--How do you filter employees who donâ€™t have a manager (MANAGER_ID is NULL)?
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE manager_id IS NULL

--ðŸ”¹ Aggregate Functions & Grouping
--How do you calculate the average salary of all employees
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM EMP

--How would you count the number of employees in each department?
SELECT COUNT(EMPLOYEE_ID) AS number_of_emp, department_id FROM EMP GROUP BY department_id

--How do you find the total salary paid in each JOB_ID?
SELECT SUM(salary)As total_salary,Job_id FROM EMP GROUP BY job_id

--How do you find departments with more than 5 employees?
SELECT COUNT(EMPLOYEE_ID)As total_emp, department_id FROM EMP GROUP BY department_id HAVING COUNT(EMPLOYEE_ID)> 5

--How would you get the maximum and minimum salary per job?
SELECT job_id, MAX(salary) as max_sal, MIN(salary) as min_sal FROM emp GROUP BY job_id

--ðŸ”¹ Joins & Subqueries
--How would you find employees whose salary is greater than the average salary?
SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Emp)

--How do you fetch details of the highest-paid employee?
SELECT TOP 1 * FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC;

with cte as (SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rnk FROM EMP) 
SELECT * FROM cte WHERE salary_rnk = 1

--What is a correlated subquery, and how would you use it with this table?
SELECT * FROM emp e WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM EMP e2 WHERE e2.department_id = e.department_id)

--How would you display manager and their direct reports using a self-join?
SELECT e1.FIRST_NAME AS manager, e2.FIRST_NAME as reporting_emp FROM Emp e1 INNER JOIN Emp e2 ON e1.EMPLOYEE_ID = e2.MANAGER_ID

-- ðŸ”¹ Date Functions & String Operations
-- How do you extract only the year or month from the HIRE_DATE column?
SELECT YEAR(hire_date),MONTH(hire_date) FROM Emp

-- How do you calculate the number of years/months an employee has worked?
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID , datediff(YEAR,HIRE_DATE,GETDATE()) AS exp_yrs FROM Emp

-- How would you concatenate FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME as a full name?
SELECT FIRST_NAME + ' ' + LAST_NAME FROM Emp

-- How do you filter employees based on partial match in EMAIL (e.g., emails ending with "gmail.com")?
SELECT * FROM Emp WHERE EMAIL LIKE '%gmail.com'

-- How would you replace null values in COMMISSION_PCT with '0%'?
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, REPLACE(COMMISSION_PCT,'-','0%') FROM Emp

-- ðŸ”¹ Advanced & Scenario-Based
-- How do you identify duplicate email addresses in the table?
SELECT COUNT(email) FROM Emp GROUP BY EMAIL HAVING COUNT(EMAIL) > 1

-- How would you get top 3 highest salaried employees per department?
WITH CTE AS (SELECT *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rnk
FROM Emp)
SELECT * FROM CTE WHERE salary_rnk < 4

-- How would you handle missing or invalid HIRE_DATE values in your queries?
SELECT FIRST_NAME,LAST_NAME,COALESCE(HIRE_DATE,CAST('2020-01-01' AS DATE)) FROM Emp

-- What indexes would you create on this table for performance improvement?
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_emp_id ON emp(EMPLOYEE_ID)

-- Alternate way using FETCH (SQL Server 2012+)
SELECT * FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 3 ROWS ONLY;

-- ðŸ”¹ Advanced SQL Questions for Practice
-- Find employees who earn more than the average salary of their department and also joined after 2020.
SELECT * FROM Emp WHERE YEAR(CAST(HIRE_DATE AS DATE)) > 2006 AND SALARY > (SELECT AVG(SALARY) FROM Emp)

-- Get the second highest salary for each department.
WITH CTE AS ( SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY DEPARTMENT_ID ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS salary_rnk FROM Emp)
SELECT c1.DEPARTMENT_ID, c1.SALARY AS second_highest_salary
FROM CTE c1
LEFT JOIN CTE c2 ON c1.DEPARTMENT_ID = c2.DEPARTMENT_ID AND c2.salary_rnk = 2
WHERE c1.salary_rnk = 1

-- List all employees who have the same salary as at least one other employee.
SELECT DISTINCT e1.* FROM Emp e1
INNER JOIN Emp e2 ON e1.SALARY = e2.SALARY
WHERE e1.EMPLOYEE_ID != e2.EMPLOYEE_ID

-- Find the department with the highest total salary expense.
SELECT TOP 1 DEPARTMENT_ID, SUM(SALARY) FROM Emp GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID ORDER BY SUM(SALARY) DESC

-- Identify employees who have never reported to a manager (excluding NULLs).
SELECT * FROM Emp WHERE MANAGER_ID = ' - '

-- Get all employees whose HIRE_DATE is the latest in their department.
WITH CTE AS (SELECT *,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY DEPARTMENT_ID ORDER BY HIRE_DATE DESC) AS latest_hire
FROM Emp)
SELECT * FROM CTE WHERE latest_hire = 1

-- List departments where the average salary is more than the overall company average salary.
SELECT * FROM Emp WHERE SALARY > (SELECT AVG(SALARY) FROM EMP)

-- List employees whose salary is within Â±10% of their managerâ€™s salary.
